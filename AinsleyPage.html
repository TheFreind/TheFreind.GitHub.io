            <p> In my opinion, Ainsley is the defacto leader of the Twat House. The captain of this 
                uncontrollable and doomed ship. She spearheads events, she doesn't hesitate in helping 
                her friends, and she's fiercely protective of the group. Any issues or schisms that
                arise will go through her and be addressed immediately. It's simply not possible to
                imagine the gang without Ainsley, as she's the social glue that holds everyone together.

                Ainsley is a quick learner. Actually, more like fiber-optic levels of quick. Starting 
                at nothing, if you teach her something new she'll catch on faster than however long it 
                took the person who is doing the teaching. It's like a Pandora's Box. You open the chest 
                of knowledge and you'll be terrified of coming back to whatever she came up with. Case in 
                point - Search for Planet X.

                You should also know that Ainsley is a tiger. If you look at her wrong, you'll soon realize
                why there is no universal healthcare in the United States. She will beat you into a pulp 
                that will be genetically imprinted into your grandchildren :)
