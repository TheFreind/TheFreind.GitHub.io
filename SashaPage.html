			<h3 class="SCP">Special Containment Procedures</h3>
			
			
			<p>Whenever possible, The Gardner is to be contained within a dark 5 x 4 x 4 meter room.
			Inspections must be held daily to find traces of caffeine and illicit mechanical parts.
			Any creation of The Gardner must be destroyed by means of obliteration from particle colliders.
			No operation involving relocation of The Gardner shall be attempted unless approved by
			two (2) class 4 personnel.

			<h3 class="Description">Description</h3>
			<p>The Gardner is a 6'3", 180 lb humanoid that patrols site 01. Psychiatric evaluations
			revealed that it goes through cycles of obsession involving a mysterious substance known to it
			as "lean", which will henceforth be referred to as The Gardner-01. No solution matching its
			chemical composition has ever been found in any repository from all 195 countries. Despite no
			higher brain functions, The Gardner is capable of sudden, extraordinary lucidity. The Gardner must
			be avoided at all costs when lucid. It is theorized that
			The Gardner-01 is an inter-dimensional entity that is imperceivable to scientific instruments, based
			off The Gardner's astute awareness of it.

			<p>When dull, The Gardner will lure prey to site 02. Moments after perceiving a sense of isolation,
			The Gardner will <strong class="REDACTED">harvest</strong> its victim for The Gardner-01. On the next morning, victims
			report <strong class="REDACTED">painful</strong> symptoms before they <strong class="REDACTED">spreads</strong>
			to the nearest vital organ. The mortality rate is measured to be no less than <strong class="REDACTED">94</strong>%.
